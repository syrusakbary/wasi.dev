  <article class="post" role="article">
    <p>Today, we announce the start of a  new standardization effort‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWASI, the WebAssembly system interface.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> Developers are starting to push WebAssembly 
beyond the browser, because it provides a fast, scalable, secure way to 
run the same code across all machines.</p>
<p>But we don‚Äôt yet have a solid foundation to build upon. Code outside 
of a browser needs a way to talk to the system‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa system interface. And
 the WebAssembly platform doesn‚Äôt have that yet.</p>
<p><strong>What: </strong>WebAssembly is an assembly language for a 
conceptual machine, not a physical one. This is why it can be run across
 a variety of different machine architectures.</p>
<p>Just as WebAssembly is an assembly language for a conceptual machine,
 WebAssembly needs a system interface for a conceptual operating system,
 not any single operating system. This way, it can be run across all 
different OSs.</p>
<p>This is what WASI is‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa system interface for the WebAssembly platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We aim to create a system interface that will be a true companion to 
WebAssembly and last the test of time. This means upholding the key 
principles of WebAssembly‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääportability and security.</p>
<p><strong>Who:</strong> We are chartering a WebAssembly subgroup to focus on standardizing <a href="https://github.com/CraneStation/wasi" target="_blank">WASI</a>. We‚Äôve already gathered interested partners, and are looking for more to join.</p>
<p>Here are some of the reasons that we, our partners, and our supporters think this is important:</p>
<h4>Sean White, Chief R&D Officer of Mozilla</h4>
<p>‚ÄúWebAssembly is already transforming the way the web brings new kinds
 of compelling content to people and empowers developers and creators to
 do their best work on the web. Up to now that‚Äôs been through browsers, 
but with WASI we can deliver the benefits of WebAssembly and the web to 
more users, more places, on more devices, and as part of more 
experiences.‚Äù</p>
<h4>Tyler McMullen, CTO of&nbsp;Fastly</h4>
<p>‚ÄúWe are taking WebAssembly beyond the browser, as a platform for 
fast, safe execution of code in our edge cloud. Despite the differences 
in environment between our edge and browsers, WASI means WebAssembly 
developers won‚Äôt have to port their code to each different platform.‚Äù</p>
<h4>Myles Borins, Node Technical Steering committee director</h4>
<p>‚ÄúWebAssembly could solve one of the biggest problems in Node‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähow to
 get close-to-native speeds and reuse code written in other languages 
like C and C++ like you can with native modules, while still remaining 
portable and secure. Standardizing this system interface is the first 
step towards making that happen.‚Äù</p>
<h4>Laurie Voss, co-founder of&nbsp;npm</h4>
<p>‚Äúnpm is tremendously excited by the potential WebAssembly holds to 
expand the capabilities of the npm ecosystem while hugely simplifying 
the process of getting native code to run in server-side JavaScript 
applications. We look forward to the results of this process.‚Äù</p>
<p>So that‚Äôs the big news! üéâ&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/featured_image.png" target="_blank"><img src="files/featured_image-500x250.png" alt="settlers on the moon" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33330" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/featured_image-500x250.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/featured_image-250x125.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/featured_image-768x384.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/featured_image.png 1012w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" width="500" height="250"></a></p>
<p>And if  you want to learn more about our proposal for how this system interface should work, keep reading.</p>
<h3>What‚Äôs a system interface?</h3>
<p>Many people talk about languages like C giving you direct access to system resources. But that‚Äôs not <em>quite </em>true<em>.</em></p>
<p>These languages don‚Äôt have direct access to do things like open or create files on most systems. Why not?</p>
<p>Because these system resources‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsuch as files, memory, and network 
connections‚Äî are too important for stability and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If one program unintentionally messes up the resources of another, 
then it could crash the program. Even worse, if a program (or user) 
intentionally messes with the resources of another, it could steal 
sensitive data.</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/01-01_crash-data-leak-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="files/01-01_crash-data-leak-1-500x220.png" alt="A frowning terminal window indicating a crash, and a file with a broken lock indicating a data leak" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33308" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/01-01_crash-data-leak-1-500x220.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/01-01_crash-data-leak-1-250x110.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/01-01_crash-data-leak-1-768x338.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" width="500" height="220"></a></p>
<p>So we need a way to control which programs and users can access which
 resources. People figured this out pretty early on, and came up with a 
way to provide this control: protection ring security.</p>
<p>With protection ring security, the operating system basically puts a 
protective barrier around the system‚Äôs resources. This is the kernel. 
The kernel is the only thing that gets to do operations like creating a 
new file or opening a file or opening a network connection.</p>
<p>The user‚Äôs programs run outside of this kernel in something called 
user mode. If a program wants to do anything like open a file, it has to
 ask the kernel to open the file for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/01-02-protection-ring-sec-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="files/01-02-protection-ring-sec-1-500x298.png" alt="A file directory structure on the left, with a protective barrier in the middle containing the operating system kernel, and an application knocking for access on the right" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33309" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/01-02-protection-ring-sec-1-500x298.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/01-02-protection-ring-sec-1-250x149.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/01-02-protection-ring-sec-1-768x457.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" width="500" height="298"></a></p>
<p>This is where the concept of the system call comes in. When a program
 needs to ask the kernel to do one of these things, it asks using a 
system call. This gives the kernel a chance to figure out which user is 
asking. Then it can see if that user has access to the file before 
opening it.</p>
<p>On most devices, this is the only way that your code can access the system‚Äôs resources‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthrough system calls.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/01-03-syscall-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="files/01-03-syscall-1-500x227.png" alt="An application asking the operating system to put data into an open file" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33310" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/01-03-syscall-1-500x227.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/01-03-syscall-1-250x114.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/01-03-syscall-1-768x349.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" width="500" height="227"></a></p>
<p>The operating system makes the system calls available. But if each 
operating system has its own system calls, wouldn‚Äôt you need a different
 version of the code for each operating system? Fortunately, you don‚Äôt.</p>
<p>How is this problem solved? Abstraction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most languages provide a standard library. While coding, the 
programmer doesn‚Äôt need to know what system they are targeting. They 
just use the interface.</p>
<p>Then, when compiling, your toolchain picks which implementation of 
the interface to use based on what system you‚Äôre targeting. This 
implementation uses functions from the operating system‚Äôs API, so it‚Äôs 
specific to the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where the system interface comes in. For example, <code>printf</code>
 being compiled for a Windows machine could use the Windows API to 
interact with the machine. If it‚Äôs being compiled for Mac or Linux, it 
will use POSIX instead.</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/02-01-implementations-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="files/02-01-implementations-1-500x267.png" alt="The interface for putc being translated into two different implementations, one implemented using POSIX and one implemented using Windows APIs" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33311" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/02-01-implementations-1-500x267.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/02-01-implementations-1-250x133.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/02-01-implementations-1-768x409.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" width="500" height="267"></a></p>
<p>This poses a problem for WebAssembly, though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With WebAssembly, you don‚Äôt know what kind of operating system you‚Äôre
 targeting even when you‚Äôre compiling. So you can‚Äôt use any single OS‚Äôs 
system interface inside the WebAssembly implementation of the standard 
library.</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/02-02-implementations-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="files/02-02-implementations-1-500x260.png" alt="an empty implementation of putc" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33312" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/02-02-implementations-1-500x260.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/02-02-implementations-1-250x130.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/02-02-implementations-1-768x399.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" width="500" height="260"></a></p>
<p>I‚Äôve talked before about how WebAssembly is <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/creating-and-working-with-webassembly-modules/">an assembly language for a conceptual machine</a>,
 not a real machine. In the same way, WebAssembly needs a system 
interface for a conceptual operating system, not a real operating 
system.</p>
<p>But there are already runtimes that can run WebAssembly outside the 
browser, even without having this system interface in place. How do they
 do it? Let‚Äôs take a look.</p>
<h3>How is WebAssembly running outside the browser&nbsp;today?</h3>
<p>The first tool for producing WebAssembly was Emscripten. It emulates a
 particular OS system interface, POSIX, on the web. This means that the 
programmer can use functions from the C standard library (libc).</p>
<p>To do this, Emscripten created its own implementation of libc. This 
implementation was split in two‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpart was compiled into the WebAssembly
 module, and the other part was implemented in JS glue code. This JS 
glue would then call into the browser, which would then talk to the OS.</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/03-01-emscripten-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="files/03-01-emscripten-1-500x329.png" alt="A Rube Goldberg machine showing how a call goes from a WebAssembly module, into Emscripten's JS glue code, into the browser, into the kernel" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33313" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/03-01-emscripten-1-500x329.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/03-01-emscripten-1-250x165.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/03-01-emscripten-1-768x505.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" width="500" height="329"></a></p>
<p>Most of the early WebAssembly code was compiled with Emscripten. So 
when people started wanting to run WebAssembly without a browser, they 
started by making Emscripten-compiled code run.</p>
<p>So these runtimes needed to create their own implementations for all of these functions that were in the JS glue code.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a problem here, though. The interface provided by this JS 
glue code wasn‚Äôt designed to be a standard, or even a public facing 
interface. That wasn‚Äôt the problem it was solving.</p>
<p>For example, for a function that would be called something like <code>read</code>  in an API that was designed to be a public interface, the JS glue code instead uses <code>_system3(which, varargs)</code>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/03-02-system3-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="files/03-02-system3-1-500x179.png" alt="A clean interface for read, vs a confusing one for system3" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33314" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/03-02-system3-1-500x179.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/03-02-system3-1-250x89.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/03-02-system3-1-768x275.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" width="500" height="179"></a></p>
<p>The first parameter, <code>which</code>, is an integer which is always the same as the number in the name (so 3 in this case).</p>
<p>The second parameter, <code>varargs</code>, are the arguments to use. It‚Äôs called <code>varargs</code>
 because you can have a variable number of them. But WebAssembly doesn‚Äôt
 provide a way to pass in a variable number of arguments to a function. 
So instead, the arguments are passed in via linear memory. This isn‚Äôt 
type safe, and it‚Äôs also slower than it would be if the arguments  could
 be passed in using registers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was fine for Emscripten running in the browser. But now runtimes
 are treating this as a de facto standard, implementing their own 
versions of the JS glue code. They are emulating an internal detail of 
an emulation layer of POSIX.</p>
<p>This means they are re-implementing choices (like passing arguments 
in as heap values) that made sense based on Emscripten‚Äôs constraints, 
even though these constraints don‚Äôt apply in their environments.</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/03-03-emulation-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="files/03-03-emulation-1-500x341.png" alt="A more convoluted Rube Goldberg machine, with the JS glue and browser being emulated by a WebAssembly runtime" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33315" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/03-03-emulation-1-500x341.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/03-03-emulation-1-250x171.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/03-03-emulation-1-768x524.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" width="500" height="341"></a></p>
<p>If we‚Äôre going to build a WebAssembly ecosystem that lasts for 
decades, we need solid foundations. This means our de facto standard 
can‚Äôt be an emulation of an emulation.</p>
<p>But what principles should we apply?</p>
<h3>What principles does a WebAssembly system interface need to&nbsp;uphold?</h3>
<p>There are two important principles that are baked into WebAssembly&nbsp;:</p>
<ul>
<li>portability</li>
<li>security</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to maintain these key principles as we move to outside-the-browser use cases.</p>
<p>As it is, POSIX and Unix‚Äôs Access Control approach to security don‚Äôt quite get us there. Let‚Äôs look at where they fall short.</p>
<h4>Portability</h4>
<p>POSIX provides source code portability. You can compile the same 
source code with different versions of libc to target different 
machines.</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/04-01-portability-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="files/04-01-portability-1-500x375.png" alt="One C source file being compiled to multiple binaries" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33316" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/04-01-portability-1-500x375.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/04-01-portability-1-250x188.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/04-01-portability-1-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" width="500" height="375"></a></p>
<p>But WebAssembly needs to go one step beyond this. We need to be able 
to compile once and run across a whole bunch of different machines. We 
need portable binaries.</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/04-02-portability-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="files/04-02-portability-1-500x484.png" alt="One C source file being compiled to a single binary" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33317" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/04-02-portability-1-500x484.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/04-02-portability-1-250x242.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/04-02-portability-1-768x743.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" width="500" height="484"></a></p>
<p>This kind of portability makes it much easier to distribute code to users.</p>
<p>For example, if Node‚Äôs native modules were written in WebAssembly, 
then users wouldn‚Äôt need to run node-gyp when they install apps with 
native modules, and developers wouldn‚Äôt need to configure and distribute
 dozens of binaries.</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>When a line of code asks the operating system to do some input or 
output, the OS needs to determine if it is safe to do what the code 
asks.</p>
<p>Operating systems typically handle this with access control that is based on ownership and groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the program might ask the OS to open a file. A user has a certain set of files that they have access to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the user starts the program, the program runs on behalf of that 
user. If the user has access to the file‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeither because they are the 
owner or because they are in a group with access‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthen the program has 
that same access, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/04-03-access-control-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="files/04-03-access-control-1-500x224.png" alt="An application asking to open a file that is relevant to what it's doing" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33318" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/04-03-access-control-1-500x224.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/04-03-access-control-1-250x112.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/04-03-access-control-1-768x344.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" width="500" height="224"></a></p>
<p>This protects users from each other. That made a lot of sense when 
early operating systems were developed. Systems were often multi-user, 
and administrators controlled what software was installed. So the most 
prominent threat was other users taking a peek at your files.</p>
<p>That has changed. Systems now are usually single user, but they are 
running code that pulls in lots of other, third party code of unknown 
trustworthiness. Now the biggest threat is that the code that you 
yourself are running will turn against you.</p>
<p>For example, let‚Äôs say that the library you‚Äôre using in an 
application gets a new maintainer (as often happens in open source). 
That maintainer might have your interest at heart‚Ä¶ or they might be one 
of the bad guys. And if they have access to do anything on your

<p>This is why using third-party libraries that can talk directly to the system can be dangerous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>WebAssembly‚Äôs way of doing security is different. WebAssembly is sandboxed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that code can‚Äôt talk directly to the OS. But then how does
 it do anything with system resources? The host (which might be a 
browser, or might be a wasm runtime) puts functions in the sandbox that 
the code can use.</p>
<p>This means that the host can limit what a program can do on a 
program-by-program basis. It doesn‚Äôt just let the program act on behalf 
of the user, calling any system call with the user‚Äôs full 
permissions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just having a mechanism for sandboxing doesn‚Äôt make a system secure 
in and of itself‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe host can still put all of the capabilities into 
the sandbox, in which case we‚Äôre no better off‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut it at least gives 
hosts the option of creating a more secure system.</p>

<p>In any system interface we design, we need to uphold these two 
principles. Portability makes it easier to develop and distribute 
software, and providing the tools for hosts to secure themselves or 
their users is an absolute must.,</p>
<h3>What should this system interface look&nbsp;like?</h3>
<p>Given those two key principles, what should the design of the WebAssembly system interface be?&nbsp;</p>
<p>That‚Äôs what we‚Äôll figure out through the standardization process. We do have a proposal to start with, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a modular set of standard interfaces</li>
<li>Start with standardizing the most fundamental module, wasi-core</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/05-01-wasi-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="files/05-01-wasi-1-500x419.png" alt="Multiple modules encased in the WASI standards effort" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33321" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-01-wasi-1-500x419.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-01-wasi-1-250x210.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-01-wasi-1-768x644.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" width="500" height="419"></a></p>
<p>What will be in wasi-core?</p>
<p>wasi-core will contain the basics that all programs need. It will 
cover much of the same ground as POSIX, including things such as files, 
network connections, clocks, and random numbers.</p>
<p>And it will take a very similar approach to POSIX for many of these 
things. For example, it will use POSIX‚Äôs file-oriented approach, where 
you have system calls such as open, close, read, and write and 
everything else basically provides augmentations on top.</p>
<p>But wasi-core won‚Äôt cover everything that POSIX does. For example, 
the process concept does not map clearly onto WebAssembly. And beyond 
that, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to say that every WebAssembly engine needs 
to support process operations like <code>fork</code>. But we also want to make it possible to standardize <code>fork</code>.</p>
<p>This is where the modular approach comes in. This way, we can get 
good standardization coverage while still allowing niche platforms to 
use only the parts of WASI that make sense for them.</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/05-02-wasi-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="files/05-02-wasi-1-500x251.png" alt="Modules filled in with possible areas for standardization, such as processes, sensors, 3D graphics, etc" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33322" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-02-wasi-1-500x251.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-02-wasi-1-250x125.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-02-wasi-1-768x385.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" width="500" height="251"></a></p>
<p>Languages like Rust will use wasi-core directly in their standard libraries. For example, Rust‚Äôs <code>open</code> is implemented by calling <code>__wasi_path_open</code> when it‚Äôs compiled to WebAssembly.</p>
<p>For C and C++, we‚Äôve created a <a href="https://github.com/CraneStation/wasi-sysroot" target="_blank">wasi-sysroot</a> that implements libc in terms of wasi-core functions.</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/05-03-open-imps-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="files/05-03-open-imps-1-500x229.png" alt="The Rust and C implementations of openat with WASI" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33323" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-03-open-imps-1-500x229.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-03-open-imps-1-250x115.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-03-open-imps-1-768x352.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" width="500" height="229"></a></p>
<p>We expect compilers like Clang to be ready to interface with the WASI
 API, and complete toolchains like the Rust compiler and Emscripten to 
use WASI as part of their system implementations</p>
<p>How does the user‚Äôs code call these WASI functions?</p>
<p>The runtime that is running the code passes the wasi-core functions in as imports.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/05-04-imports-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="files/05-04-imports-1-500x285.png" alt="A runtime placing an imports object into the sandbox" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33324" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-04-imports-1-500x285.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-04-imports-1-220x125.png 220w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-04-imports-1-250x143.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-04-imports-1-768x438.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" width="500" height="285"></a></p>
<p>This gives us portability, because each host can have their own 
implementation of wasi-core that is specifically written for their 
platform‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfrom WebAssembly  runtimes like Mozilla‚Äôs wasmtime and 
Fastly‚Äôs Lucet, to Node, or even the browser.</p>
<p>It also gives us sandboxing because the host can choose which 
wasi-core functions to pass in‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääso, which system calls to allow‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääon a 
program-by-program basis. This preserves security.</p>

<p>WASI gives us a way to extend this security even further. It brings in more concepts from capability-based security.</p>
<p>Traditionally, if code needs to open a file, it calls <code>open</code>
 with a string, which is the path name. Then the OS does a check to see 
if the code has permission (based on the user who started the program).</p>
<p>With WASI, if you‚Äôre calling a function that needs to access a file, 
you have to pass in a file descriptor, which has permissions attached to
 it. This could be for the file itself, or for a directory that contains
 the file.</p>
<p>This way, you can‚Äôt have code that randomly asks to open <code>/etc/passwd</code>. Instead, the code can only operate on the directories that are passed in to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/05-06-openat-path-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="files/05-06-openat-path-1-500x192.png" alt="Two evil apps in sandboxes. The one on the left is using POSIX and succeeds at opening a file it shouldn't have access to. The other is using WASI and can't open the file." class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33326" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-06-openat-path-1-500x192.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-06-openat-path-1-250x96.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-06-openat-path-1-768x296.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" width="500" height="192"></a></p>
<p>This makes it possible to safely give sandboxed code more access to 
different system calls‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbecause the capabilities of these system calls 
can be limited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this happens on a module-by-module basis. By default, a module 
doesn‚Äôt have any access to file descriptors. But if code in one module 
has a file descriptor, it can choose to pass that file descriptor to 
functions it calls in other modules. Or it can create more limited 
versions of the file descriptor to pass to the other functions.</p>
<p>So the runtime passes in the file descriptors that an app can use to 
the top level code, and then file descriptors get propagated through the
 rest of the system on an as-needed basis.</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/05-07-file-perms-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="files/05-07-file-perms-1-500x423.png" alt="The runtime passing a directory to the app, and then then app passing a file to a function" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33327" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-07-file-perms-1-500x423.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-07-file-perms-1-250x211.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/03/05-07-file-perms-1-768x649.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" width="500" height="423"></a></p>
<p>This gets WebAssembly closer to the principle of least privilege, 
where a module can only access the exact resources it needs to do its 
job.</p>
<p>These concepts come from capability-oriented systems, like CloudABI 
and Capsicum. One problem with capability-oriented systems is that it is
 often hard to port code to them. But we think this problem can be 
solved.</p>
<p>If code already uses <code>openat</code> with relative file paths, compiling the code will just work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If code uses <code>open</code> and migrating to the <code>openat</code> style is too much up-front investment, WASI can provide an incremental solution. With <a href="https://github.com/musec/libpreopen" target="_blank">libpreopen</a>, you can create a list of file paths that the application legitimately needs access to. Then you can use <code>open</code>, but only with those paths.</p>
<h3>What‚Äôs next?</h3>
<p>We think wasi-core  is a good start. It preserves WebAssembly‚Äôs 
portability and security, providing a solid foundation for an ecosystem.</p>
<p>But there are still questions we‚Äôll need to address after wasi-core is fully standardized. Those questions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>asynchronous I/O</li>
<li>file watching</li>
<li>file locking</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the beginning, so if you have ideas for how to solve these problems, join us!</p>
